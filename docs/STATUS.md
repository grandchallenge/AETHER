# STATUS

## GCL ecosystem admission (2026-08-08)

Repository custody moved from `fyremael/AETHER` to
`grandchallenge/AETHER` without changing repository ID `1184906615` or the
protected `main` candidate `62272646689b726bdb54bd94b86f42efc812f618`.
The recent Orbital work remains separately preserved in draft PR #53 at
`a4b513bdb63b65a29463656d56bfbec035882401`; it is not part of `main`.

The bounded admission profile is protected through `gcl-standards` PR #33 as
a high-risk provider with no claim-promotion authority and a fail-closed
`controlled_alpha` policy. Repository-controls PR #54 and release-identity PR
#57 are also protected. Live `main` remains under classic branch protection;
the provider ruleset, immutable release-tag ruleset, shared conformance checks,
and their exact post-migration readback are not yet effective.

The `GCL-AETHER-CONFORMANCE-001` migration adds CODEOWNERS, the shared policy
and action-security checks, an exact governed-profile source, and ruleset-aware
fail-closed verification. Classic protection remains required throughout the
transition and may be removed only after the replacement readback is complete
and equivalent or stricter. No prerelease or promotion record is authorized,
the live INTELLECT/GCL bridge remains on hold, and controlled alpha remains the
active label. The exact admission and AETHER #51 pilot evidence is recorded in
[`docs/evidence/AETHER_GCL_ECOSYSTEM_ADMISSION_2026-08-08.md`](evidence/AETHER_GCL_ECOSYSTEM_ADMISSION_2026-08-08.md).

## Release-control reset (2026-07-21)

Release control now separates immutable product/package identity from immutable
qualification-tooling identity. PR CI is cancelable and affected-scope.
Protected-main CI derives the exact push range and runs the full OS/MSRV,
Postgres, container, pilot package, and admin/operator product matrix unless
every changed path is an explicitly enumerated qualification-tooling file or
documentation path. Manual dispatch, missing/zero push ancestry, new paths,
and changes to the CI scoping architecture itself fail closed to the full
matrix. The protected check names remain `Required CI gate` and `Required
Supply Chain gate`.

Release Readiness starts with deterministic preflight for dependencies,
schemas, subject cardinality, prerequisite projections, package digest,
capacity acceptance, and synthetic assemble/verifier contracts. Generic
quality evidence is projected from exact-SHA prerequisite outcomes and
independently requeried; package-bound operational qualification still runs.
Hosted qualification run `30176613797` passed on its first attempt for product
`4e5dd1e0144299b356b6292f275f18f304f49f5f` using protected tooling
`b7a9daccd239b7c5a028f3f344309628a19bf54d`. The independent verifier
reported `passed` with no blockers, package digest
`075a019716ccc86f8829d1aec7a044d23ec6b479673ac5dc148711c30435f1ac`,
and evidence-bundle digest
`646da8acc671c30fecb04ed36b657b63e417876c9f2faa49e745147b1977c301`.
The fail-closed main-routing change was then validated by protected-main CI
run `30182860543`, Supply Chain run `30182860551`, and Pages run
`30182860552`, all green on attempt 1 at
`eec7236086d96766916b326359e76083c8338291`.

## Python alternate-runner lifecycle repair (2026-07-27)

The Python HTTP client integration fixture no longer starts the service through
`cargo run` with an unread output pipe. It performs a bounded build first,
launches the reported service executable directly, writes service output to a
file-backed temporary log, and guarantees terminate/kill/wait/close cleanup
from both failed class setup and normal teardown. This removes the path where a
Cargo lock could exhaust the 90-second readiness deadline and a live
`stdout.read()` could then wait indefinitely for EOF.

Lifecycle regression tests cover graceful termination and forced-kill cleanup.
The repaired fixture passed from a fresh Cargo target after 251.9 seconds,
crossing the former 90-second failure boundary without leaking a process or
file handle. The complete alternate runner passed 125 tests under Python
development warnings, and the pytest surface passed the same 125 tests.

## Current state

The repository has advanced from a pure specification bundle to a functioning
single-node semantic kernel. Its active claim is deliberately contained while
the July 2026 audit findings are remediated:

> Controlled single-node alpha with a real Rust semantic kernel, limited to one
> visibility domain, trusted appenders, and explicitly supported deployment
> boundaries.

In plain terms: AETHER can now journal facts, replay exact cuts, derive
recursive truths, explain them, and serve them through authenticated boundaries
without asking the user to imagine the kernel into existence.

The repository now also carries a governed incident blackboard demo pack that
repackages those existing proof surfaces in plain product language for
design-partner conversations. That packaging layer is documentation and demo
work, not a new kernel-semantic claim.

The commercialization layer now also carries an AI support resolution desk app
pack as the flagship ML-facing end-user application. That pack reuses the
current pilot, sidecar, replay, and explanation surfaces to make AETHER
legible in a buyer-relevant support workflow before broader platform language.

Post-v1 hardening work is now also underway as an internal-first QA program:
persona-based sweeps, disclosure guidance, stronger defect intake, and
scheduled non-blocking hardening automation now exist to hunt admin,
operator, boundary, and front-door failures before they are promoted into
blocking release gates.

That QA layer now also includes a repeatable perturbation-and-capacity sweep
that composes the persona pass, fresh performance bundles, drift checks, and
larger release-mode stress workloads into one saved planning artifact for
single-node scale discussions.

That scaling lane now also has a first-class live sizing system: typed
capacity curves, concrete `S`/`M`/`L`/`XL` node classes, a recurring capacity
bundle, and a scheduled GitHub tracker issue for headroom and ceiling drift.

The unrestricted kernel acceptance slice remains substantial, but the
policy-aware portion of v1 closure is reopened. The reproduced defects and
binding repair sequence are recorded in
`docs/COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_2026-07-09.md` and
`docs/REMEDIATION_PROGRAMME.md`. `docs/V1_CLOSEOUT.md` and the semantic
compliance matrix now carry that reopened boundary explicitly.

Remediation execution has completed the local R1 semantic repair, R2 proof
identity repair, and R3 transactional append-admission repair: normalized
`PolicyScope`, cut-then-project scoped replay, dependency-closure
certification, scoped program compilation, typed scoped runtime bundles, a
central service evaluation path, federated/sidecar projection, and
projection-local evaluation keys are implemented. The compatibility evaluator
now also accepts source datoms and a source rule program and scopes both before
replay, compilation, negation, aggregation, or closure; it no longer filters an
unrestricted result. Service evaluations emit deterministic execution receipts
and persisted opaque trace handles backed by bounded in-memory or SQLite
execution stores. Equivalent executions reuse the same tuple handle instead of
growing trace storage; execution and expired-handle retention are both bounded.
Resolution rechecks namespace
and current policy, supports digest-checked replay, survives restart and
backup/restore, and binds federated source cuts, epochs, prefix digests, and
source execution IDs. Rust, HTTP, reports, Go, Python, the TUI, demos, and
notebooks use handles; bare tuple explanation returns
`409 ambiguous_tuple_reference`. The external mixed-policy and durable-proof
claims remain contained until the later immutable-evidence and operational
qualification phases bind these local results to an exact candidate.

Namespace writes now pass one canonical active schema before journal commit.
In-memory, SQLite, and Postgres compare schema identity and exact journal cut
atomically with batch append and durable receipt creation. Existing prefixes
are sealed as certified baselines or visible quarantines; schema activation
contends with append on the same cut. Partition leaders issue the receipt and
followers preserve and verify its exact identity. Schema discovery/admin,
dry-run, receipt, structured-error, Go, and Python surfaces are implemented.

R4's immutable evidence layer is also implemented locally. Versioned envelope,
bundle, waiver, release-subject, promotion-record, and gate-policy contracts now separate release requirements
from observations. A standard-library runner captures clean commit/tree/ref,
workflow/run/job, exact commands, inputs, attempts, outputs, and expiry; the
verifier re-hashes every byte and recomputes a deterministic verdict.
The commercial ledger is policy-only and rejects authored outcomes. A reusable
exact-candidate workflow now consumes the successful exact-SHA Supply Chain
package after Release Readiness has downloaded, digest-checked, and tested
those exact bytes. Eighteen candidate-bound subjects are assembled only after
operational readiness, including customer-workflow evidence. The workflow
emits a SHA/run/attempt-named bundle and delegates verification to a dependent
job. Official verification now requires signed package provenance plus live
producer and prerequisite run/job outcomes and redownloaded artifact bytes; a
numeric run declaration, declared host, or correctly named file is
insufficient. The qualification and generated promotion-record path are
implemented locally. A prior independent adversarial review found no remaining
P0/P1 defects in the then-visible evidence path, but hosted qualification later
exposed that the capacity producer measured one service per worker and capped
node-class recommendations with an unscaled calibration-host plateau. Local
validation was green before hosted qualification. PR #28 has since merged and
protected candidate `11380eed81d0690717637a6926ae0087547205c2` passed exact-SHA
CI, Supply Chain, Pages, and Capacity Planning. Release Readiness run
`29625522886` failed the unchanged service performance gate because its first
durable coordination restart stalled while subsequent passes remained stable.
No official bundle or passed verdict was emitted. Phase-level, all-pass restart
instrumentation and ten fresh native Windows processes localized `99.67%` of
first-observed restart time to separately committed execution-trace
persistence; replay and recursive execution remained millisecond-scale. The
hash-bound diagnostic record and bounded batch-persistence follow-up are in
`docs/RESTART_LATENCY_INVESTIGATION.md`. Atomic SQLite batch persistence is now
implemented with rollback and restart coverage; ten fresh local processes cut
first-observed mean restart latency from `3,347.816 ms` to `30.579 ms`.
The derived execution catalog now uses the established journal WAL and
`synchronous=NORMAL` posture plus derived-store-specific suppression of
last-connection checkpointing. The latest ten-process run bounded first
persistence to `7.239 ms` and service close to `1.198 ms`; five local exact
baseline/current comparisons passed the unchanged gate. Backup/restore coverage
now proves the database/WAL/SHM snapshot boundary. PR #29 merged, and protected
candidate `083833634c174ce04f4a7329b78bcdcdb241024d` passed exact-SHA CI,
Supply Chain, Pages, and Capacity Planning. Release Readiness run `29642281070`
then exposed an in-repo host-policy mismatch: every latency and drift threshold
passed, but the beta gate rejected its pinned `github-windows-latest` evidence
because the policy named only `dev-chad-windows-native`. No official bundle or
passed verdict was emitted. The policy now explicitly permits those two
Windows evidence hosts while continuing to reject every other host and
preserving same-host drift comparisons. A policy-integrity gate pins every
required drift and latency surface and rejects missing, duplicate, malformed,
non-finite, or status-weakened entries; failed readiness runs also retain their
primary failure in a partial immutable manifest. A new protected candidate must
pass the complete sequence. This does not widen the controlled-alpha claim.

Protected successor `d0bb67d0388db6305865f83648e766e3786e0f69`
passed exact-SHA CI, Supply Chain, Pages, the repaired shared-service Capacity
Planning gate, protected approval, and complete Windows operational readiness.
Release Readiness run `29863838006` then failed closed before bundle assembly
because the non-waivable Python boundary invokes pytest while the reusable
evidence workflow had not declared pytest as a release dependency. No official
bundle or dependent verdict exists. The immutable coordinates and disposition
are in `docs/evidence/RELEASE_READINESS_D0BB67D.md`. The focused repair pins
the test runner and retains exact gate diagnostics before an explicit fail
barrier; a new protected candidate is required. The external claim remains
controlled alpha.

Protected successor `7c9a0763627e9c11f88ad72520116ddd8e15ac71`
then passed exact-SHA CI, Supply Chain, Pages, the shared-service Capacity
gate, protected approval, complete Windows operational readiness, exact gate
capture and all 18-subject bundle assembly. Release Readiness run
`29881660086` failed in its dependent verifier because it compared the
readiness caller's exact run/attempt binding to the reusable producer's full
workflow envelope. No dependent verdict was uploaded, so the producer's
internal `computed_verdict: passed` is diagnostic only and cannot promote.
The immutable coordinates and disposition are in
`docs/evidence/RELEASE_READINESS_7C9A076.md`. The focused repair preserves full
producer validation while comparing the readiness binding to the exact
run/attempt projection; a new protected candidate is required. The external
claim remains controlled alpha.

R5.1-R5.6 are now implemented locally. The service has strict dependency and
package gates, verified transport modes, independent namespace admission,
capability-negotiated clients, exact operational verdict automation, and
fail-closed resource controls. Request/document/rule/runtime/result/rate limits,
queue timeout semantics, finite execution retention, audit backpressure, and
typed no-partial-mutation failures are published in
`docs/RESOURCE_CONTROL_CONTRACT.md`. Hosted exact-candidate runs, ingress
isolation evidence, real TLS-Postgres evidence, and independent bundle
verification remain required; the public claim therefore remains controlled
alpha.

R6 responsibility recovery is also implemented locally. Service semantics,
HTTP/deployment, sidecars, partitions/federation, performance, and pilot proof
packs now live in dedicated crates; `aether_api` is a compatibility facade.
`aether_plan` owns a versioned executable schedule with delta, aggregate, and
provenance nodes, and runtime consumes it fail-closed. The ownership contract,
measurements, and dependency gate are in `docs/ARCHITECTURE_BOUNDARIES.md`.

R7 hosting controls are now explicit rather than assumed. CI and Supply Chain
publish stable aggregate check names, Actions is constrained to full-SHA
GitHub/allowlisted actions (including nested composite dependencies), and a
read-only verifier compares the live branch, Actions, security, and environment
settings with `.github/repository-controls.json`. Commercial beta remains
blocked until protected `main`, protected release approval, every required
bundle subject, exact-SHA Pages, and independent bundle verification all pass.

- repository front-door docs, contribution guidance, and worked examples now exist
- a governed incident blackboard commercialization document, runnable demo, and front-door docs/site packaging now exist as the canonical adjacent-next design-partner exemplar over the current pilot proof
- an AI support resolution desk commercialization document, runnable demo, site page, and Colab notebook now exist as the flagship ML-facing working app pack over the current pilot proof
- an M6 operating-proof Colab notebook now exists for status, coordination reports, cut diffs, tuple proof traces, audit intent, and benchmark trend artifacts
- a post-v1 QA hardening program now exists with a governing rubric, responsible-disclosure policy, stronger issue templates, a repeatable persona sweep runner, and a scheduled/manual non-blocking hardening workflow
- the scheduled hardening workflow now also publishes promotion metrics, updates a standing GitHub tracker issue, and can open a promotion PR when the next pack satisfies the documented streak threshold
- release-readiness now emits an explicit hardening gate-state summary that separates blocking packs from diagnostic packs and reports the latest pass/fail/skipped evidence
- admin and operator hardening packs are now promoted into blocking CI/release-readiness gates after five downloaded scheduled QA Hardening metrics artifacts showed consecutive `passed` statuses, exceeding the configured three-run threshold
- a tracked commercial release readiness ledger separates design-partner alpha, commercial beta, and GA; its active target is now controlled design-partner alpha, and authored ledger state is not accepted as proof of beta readiness
- release-readiness now also emits a Service v2 operability proof artifact with a direct SQLite namespace restart/replay drill, Postgres availability status, CI container-smoke coverage, current-run package backup/restore-through-restart proof, and admin/operator promotion status
- release-readiness now emits a versioned rollback record that ties the packaged bundle, package-local backup/restore proof, restart/replay evidence, packaged upgrade/rollback playbook, and Postgres export/restore boundary into one release artifact
- release-readiness now emits a customer workflow acceptance artifact that runs the AI support resolution desk demo and checks the buyer-facing workflow markers
- release-readiness now emits a performance beta gate artifact that enforces
  explicit approved-Windows-host thresholds for gated same-host drift,
  restart/replay, in-process report latency, and pilot HTTP read paths
- release-readiness emits a security/key lifecycle artifact that verifies package token rotation, token-command/auth-reload tests, secret-manager documentation, and an honestly named package file/checksum manifest
- strict CycloneDX 1.5 Rust, Go, and assembled-package SBOM generation now
  covers lockfiles, package URLs, hashes, licenses, dependency graphs, and every
  packaged file; pinned cargo-audit, govulncheck, Trivy, Gitleaks, CodeQL,
  provenance/SBOM attestations, immutable Actions/images, and Dependabot are
  wired into the Supply Chain workflow, pending a successful hosted exact-SHA run
- Postgres now defaults to forced `verify_full` TLS, supports explicit
  `verify_ca`, CA bundles and optional mTLS identity, and permits plaintext only
  through an explicit literal-loopback development mode; the HTTP config rejects
  non-loopback plaintext unless it declares a trusted `https://` ingress boundary
- non-secret service status exposes transport mode, trust-root posture, CA count,
  and client-certificate presence without database URLs, certificate/key paths,
  or key material; the exact-digest local Postgres fixtures pass trusted CA,
  hostname mismatch, explicit `verify_ca`, untrusted/expired certificate, no-
  downgrade, mTLS, and two-CA rotation tests, while the hosted exact-SHA run is
  still pending
- namespace services now live behind independent per-namespace handles and all
  synchronous kernel/storage work uses a bounded blocking executor; saturation
  returns structured `503 namespace_busy` with `Retry-After`, same-namespace
  order remains deterministic, and initialization is single-handle
- replicated authority partitions now lock independently, while audit uses a
  bounded in-memory FIFO plus a bounded single-writer queue with visible
  backpressure instead of holding the in-memory audit lock across slow I/O
- the HTTP boundary now publishes capability-negotiated trace-handle, schema-ref,
  append-receipt, and structured-error contracts; typed Rust helpers plus Go,
  Python, TUI, CLI report commands, and notebook preflights prevent silent
  fallback, while audit telemetry makes legacy tuple endpoints and omitted
  schema refs visible
- Capacity Planning now downloads matrix artifacts into their declared root,
  asserts the complete input layout, and always uploads a hashed inventory;
  Pages embeds and verifies the exact deployed source SHA/version; performance
  drift retains all five predeclared samples and no longer retries red into green
- the existing beta-candidate runner remains available for diagnostics, but it does not qualify a commercial beta until R4 replaces authored/path-based readiness with exact-candidate immutable evidence
- the commercial readiness ledger now targets controlled design-partner alpha; commercial beta is blocked by six non-waivable remediation gates, and GA remains blocked by its separate release, support/security, distribution, and distributed-truth gates
- a repeatable perturbation sweep now exists to run the persona pass, full-stack benchmark snapshot, host-aware drift checks, deeper ignored stress workloads, and single-node capacity projections in one artifact pack
- a typed capacity-planning layer now exists over perturbation and matrix evidence, with measured board/closure/replay/concurrency ladders, concrete hardware-class guidance, explicit scale-out triggers, and a scheduled GitHub tracker workflow
- a lightweight performance trend index now exists over saved run bundles and tracked accepted baselines so latest/prior/baseline context is visible without manually opening every benchmark artifact

Still open:

- protected candidate `5e4f95a50792a7a301598abc34f6fd23e32bb91d`
  passed exact-SHA CI, Supply Chain, Pages, and Capacity Planning, but Release
  Readiness run `29678877127` failed because the canonical-package staging

- official exact-candidate qualification of the locally green policy-scoped semantics
- official exact-candidate qualification of durable, non-aliasing trace identity

  for the exact candidate SHA
- hosted confirmation that the verified-TLS Postgres matrix passes for the exact

- candidate `7c9a0763627e9c11f88ad72520116ddd8e15ac71` passed exact-SHA CI,
  Supply Chain, Pages, Capacity, protected approval, complete operational
  readiness and 18-subject bundle production. Release Readiness run
  `29881660086` failed in the dependent verifier because caller run/attempt
  identity was incorrectly compared with the producer's full workflow
  envelope. No dependent verdict exists; the immutable coordinates and
  disposition are in `docs/evidence/RELEASE_READINESS_7C9A076.md`
- post-v1 DSL ergonomics and document modularity beyond the current canonical surface
- production hardening for the optional Postgres journal deployment path beyond current parity/concurrency coverage
- production-hardened kernel service integrations beyond the current minimal HTTP boundary
- mature Go/Python client ecosystems beyond the current first real boundary clients
- persistent benchmark dashboards and long-lived trend storage beyond the current run bundles, matrix summaries, trend index, perturbation artifacts, and uploaded workflow artifacts

## Immediate focus

The pytest dependency and gate-diagnostic repair passed on protected candidate
`7c9a0763627e9c11f88ad72520116ddd8e15ac71`, as did CI, Supply Chain, Pages,
Capacity, operational readiness, exact gate capture and 18-subject bundle
production. Its dependent verifier exposed a caller/producer workflow-binding
type mismatch and uploaded no verdict. The immediate work is the focused
run/attempt projection repair plus cross-run/attempt regression coverage.
After independent review and merge, qualification must restart from a new
protected SHA/tree under `docs/REMEDIATION_PROGRAMME.md`; C5 remains
permanently failed.
Feature broadening across policy, service execution, append, proof identity, or
release claims stays frozen until the relevant repaired contract is green:

- keep the temporary controlled-alpha claim identical across status, roadmap, limitations, commercialization, and site source
- preserve the now-green local R1-R3 semantic, proof-identity, and append-admission contracts while qualifying them through immutable exact-candidate evidence
- run and independently verify the new official exact-candidate bundle; keep its
  beta verdict blocked until every R5 subject is present and verified
- replace self-authored readiness with immutable exact-candidate evidence before restoring any beta language
- keep admin and operator hardening gates blocking, and do not promote user or exec checks until their release-blocking criteria are explicitly accepted
- keep commercial beta and GA blocked until their separate programme gates are backed by current evidence
- continue hardening the single-host replicated authority-partition prototype with longer recovery drills, clearer operator presets, and measured promotion/follower-replay evidence without pretending it is a generalized cluster manager
- continue Service v2 hardening around namespace isolation, Postgres journal parity, container smoke, and design-partner deployment docs while keeping SQLite the package default and sidecars local/journal-subordinated
- add longer-duration scheduled operability evidence beyond the current release and launch gates
- decide how far to widen audit context from the current semantic cut/query/tuple/diff fields into fuller operator intent
- decide which post-v1 ergonomic DSL extensions matter beyond the now-implemented canonical surface
- continue runtime optimization now that the current bounded-aggregation requirement is covered and the replicated federated read path has its first cache
- decide how far to widen imported-fact federation beyond the current provenance-exact single-goal query shape
- let the new perturbation sweep accumulate repeated host evidence so scaling projections become a trend rather than a single run
- use the new capacity tracker to watch for meaningful headroom drift and keep single-node guidance current as the benchmark matrix evolves
- continue building compelling working applications on top of the pilot, starting with ML-relevant support operations and then widening only where the live proof remains honest
