# ROADMAP

## Immediate: restore the bounded operator session surface

Protect the #81 pilot-tool correction after the six-case runtime smoke test and required checks pass. Use an isolated checkout preserving committed line endings; verify exact fixture/schema/protocol/runtime bytes before a separately identified session. Preserve the stopped #79 attempt and collect no replacement timing for it.

## Immediate: prove release-control v2

- confirm stable required check names and event-specific skip policy on a PR
  and protected-main integration run;
- run preflight for a previously selected product SHA with a newer tooling SHA
  and confirm the package digest remains unchanged;
- complete one hosted readiness run and independently verify its v2 bundle
  before reopening commercial-beta promotion;
- measure runner minutes after dependency grouping and affected-path routing.

This document is the forward-looking companion to `docs/STATUS.md`.

`STATUS` answers “what exists now.” `ROADMAP` answers “what should we build
next without disturbing the semantic center.”

## Milestone Spine

The original unrestricted v1 milestone spine is substantially implemented and
recorded in `docs/V1_CLOSEOUT.md`. Policy-aware closure is reopened under the
July 2026 remediation programme.

The active external claim during remediation is:

> Controlled single-node alpha with a real Rust semantic kernel, limited to one
> visibility domain, trusted appenders, and explicitly supported deployment
> boundaries.

| Milestone | Status | Meaning now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `M0` | Complete | Rust substrate core exists |
| `M1` | Complete | Deterministic resolver core exists |
| `M2` | Complete | Rule compiler and planning exist |
| `M3` | Implemented locally; qualification pending | Recursive runtime, stratified negation, provenance, and bounded aggregation execute inside policy-scoped replay and compilation, including the compatibility evaluator |
| `M4` | Controlled-alpha boundary only | Authenticated service, reports, execution-scoped proof identity, schema-admitted writes, and a verified-TLS transport contract exist; hosted transport and immutable release evidence remain blocked |
| `M5` | Complete for first boundary layer | Go shell and Python SDK are real, but still early ecosystems |

R1-R3 are locally implemented and green across the workspace: policy scope is now
semantic input to replay, compilation, runtime, service documents, federation,
reports, and sidecar cuts. R1 remains evidence-pending rather than externally
closed until its scheduled Postgres parity and performance matrix are captured
by the immutable R4 evidence pipeline. Execution-scoped trace handles and
transactional namespace-schema append admission are now implemented locally;
the R4 schemas, runner, deterministic bundler, cryptographic/API-bound verifier,
policy-only ledger, candidate-bound subject envelopes, canonical-package
qualification flow, promotion-record validator, negative suite, and two-stage
reusable workflow are implemented locally. Independent P0/P1 review of the
focused qualification implementation is complete and merged. Protected
candidate `11380eed81d0690717637a6926ae0087547205c2` passed CI, Supply Chain,
Pages, and Capacity, then failed Release Readiness on first-restart service
latency. The bounded remediation in `docs/RESTART_LATENCY_INVESTIGATION.md`
batches execution manifest/traces atomically, uses WAL/`synchronous=NORMAL`,
and avoids a last-connection checkpoint while preserving database/WAL/SHM
backup semantics. Protected successor
`083833634c174ce04f4a7329b78bcdcdb241024d` passed exact-SHA CI, Supply Chain,
Pages, and Capacity. Its Release Readiness run passed every measured drift and
latency threshold but exposed a policy wiring defect: the pinned GitHub Windows
evidence host was not in the beta host policy. The policy now fail-closed allows
only the native Windows qualification host and the official GitHub Windows
runner. Later candidates failed closed on canonical-package staging and then on
the quiesced backup/restore plus current Postgres-marker contract; those focused
repairs have merged. Protected candidate
`64797af68261bc72618487e47f8f44fae3a11d28` passed CI, Supply Chain, Pages,
Capacity Planning and the complete operational-readiness suite, but Release
Readiness rejected its capacity subject before bundle assembly: the M envelope
recommended 16 operators against the unchanged minimum of 32. Review showed
that the old concurrency producer created one service per worker and used a
noisy 4-vCPU plateau as an unscaled node-class cap. The merged repair measures
one shared service, separates setup from measurement, derives from raw
p95/error evidence and makes the independent subject verifier recompute the
policy rung. Its successor passed the repaired capacity gate; full
qualification still requires bundle verification, the dependent verdict and a
fresh independent verdict.

That repaired successor, `d0bb67d0388db6305865f83648e766e3786e0f69`,
passed exact-SHA CI, Supply Chain, Pages, Capacity and operational readiness.
Its evidence producer failed before bundle assembly because the gate policy
uses pytest but the reusable workflow did not declare pytest in the pinned
release dependencies. The next focused repair pins the runner and always
retains gate diagnostics before failing. After review and merge, qualification
restarts from a new protected candidate; C4 cannot be rerun or promoted.

Its successor, `7c9a0763627e9c11f88ad72520116ddd8e15ac71`, passed exact-SHA
CI, Supply Chain, Pages, Capacity, operational readiness, gate capture and all
18-subject bundle production. The dependent verifier then failed because it
compared the readiness caller's exact run/attempt binding to the reusable
producer's full workflow envelope. No dependent verdict was emitted. The
focused repair validates the full producer separately and compares only its
exact run/attempt projection to the readiness binding. After review and merge,
qualification restarts from a new protected candidate; C5 cannot be rerun or
promoted.

The roadmap is no longer about proving the kernel can exist. Its immediate job
is to repair the correctness and claim boundaries before widening resumes.

## Current Planning Rule

Every next-step decision should preserve three properties:

- exact local truth stays exact
- derived meaning stays replayable and explainable
- outer layers do not quietly redefine inner semantics

If a proposed feature weakens one of those, it is the wrong next step.

The July 2026 review record is
`docs/COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_2026-07-09.md`, with supporting detail in
`docs/V2_EXTERNAL_REVIEW.md`. `docs/REMEDIATION_PROGRAMME.md` is the binding
execution sequence. Feature broadening that touches policy, service execution,
append, proof identity, or release claims stays frozen until its prerequisite
programme gate is green.

## Active Tracks

### 1. Post-v1 QA hardening and defect intake

Focus:

- run persona-based sweeps across admin, operator, user, and exec perspectives
- keep the first pass internal-first and diagnostic before making it blocking
- mature the bug/spec-gap/usability-gap/security intake posture
- run measured perturbation and capacity sweeps so scaling discussions stay tied to host evidence rather than intuition
- use the disposable exact-SHA Colab Linux lane for contained correctness and variance diagnostics while keeping all promotion authority on the protected Windows candidate path
- promote only the most stable hardening checks into `CI` and release-readiness
- use GitHub workflow artifacts, tracker issues, and promotion PRs to make that promotion path explicit rather than memory-based

Non-goal:

- do not launch a paid public bug bounty before the private disclosure path, evidence discipline, and promotion rules are calm enough to support it

### 2. Post-pilot service hardening

Focus:

- deepen the new status/reload/backup surfaces into broader operational discipline
- complete the Service v2 design-partner path: namespace-aware service isolation, tagged storage config, optional Postgres authoritative journal deployments, and container smoke evidence without changing kernel semantics
- keep deployment and upgrade discipline coherent as the operator surface grows
- extend cut-diff and proof surfaces without widening beyond exact pilot semantics
- add longer-duration soak and recovery evidence around the now-hardened bundle

### 3. Distributed-truth execution

Focus:

- keep the single-host replicated authority-partition prototype on an evidence path: restart-safe metadata reload, manual promotion, follower replay, stale-epoch fencing, lag/degraded status, and divergent-prefix rejection before broader consensus machinery
- widen durable federated service boundaries only where provenance remains exact
- keep imported-fact widening constrained to provenance-preserving shapes
- delay generalized consensus machinery until the current exact-local-truth model is exhausted

Governing docs:

- `docs/ADR/0001-authority-partitions-and-federated-cuts.md`
- `docs/FEDERATED_TRUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

### 4. Post-v1 language and runtime ergonomics

Focus:

- modular authoring and cleaner document composition
- richer explain/query ergonomics
- runtime optimization beyond the now-closed v1 bounded-aggregation slice

Non-goal:

- do not treat the reopened policy-aware closure as ordinary ergonomics work;
  finish the R1 correctness gate first

### 5. Operational evidence and release discipline

Focus:

- historical benchmark trend storage
- repeated perturbation/capacity evidence across hosts and time
- mature the new capacity tracker until node-class, ceiling, and envelope drift are visible without manual artifact archaeology
- stronger release promotion evidence
- keep controlled design-partner alpha as the active target until R7
- replace authored/path-based readiness with immutable exact-candidate evidence
- obtain exact-SHA hosted evidence from the implemented CycloneDX,
  vulnerability/license/code/secret gates and verify package/SBOM attestations
  plus repository protection settings
- keep the successful Supply Chain artifact as the canonical package; never
  rebuild candidate bytes inside Release Readiness
- promote commercial beta only from a generated immutable record whose official
  and independent verdict bytes are identical and passed
- keep GA at `0/4` until support/incident posture, multi-platform distribution,
  signed promotion, and distributed-truth qualification pass separately

### 6. Product legibility and design-partner packaging

Focus:

- keep the front door anchored in operator questions and practical utility before kernel jargon
- package the AI support resolution desk as the flagship ML-facing working app pack
- keep the governed incident blackboard as the broader governed-workspace reference pattern
- make adjacent-next agentic stories concrete without widening beyond current proof

## What Is Deliberately Not The Immediate Roadmap

Not every desirable capability should be pulled forward.

Deliberately not the near-term center:

- a broad multi-tenant platform story
- replicated sidecar control planes before replicated authority partitions
- Postgres as a SQL rule engine, derived-state authority, or sidecar catalog backend in Service v2
- post-v1 DSL flourish for its own sake
- feature breadth that outruns explainability or replay discipline

## Near-Term Decision Order

If the team needs a practical ordering, use this one:

1. `R0`: contain claims and freeze scope
2. `R1`: make policy semantic input and prove noninterference
3. `R2`: execution-scoped handles implemented locally; immutable candidate evidence remains pending
4. `R3`: transactional namespace-schema append admission implemented locally; immutable candidate evidence remains pending
5. `R4`: immutable exact-candidate evidence implemented locally with signed
   provenance and live run/job/artifact verification; first green official run pending
6. `R5`: supply-chain, transport, concurrency isolation, capability-negotiated
   client migration, operational automation, and service resource controls are
   implemented locally; complete hosted exact-candidate evidence remains pending
7. `R6`: responsibility crates and executable-plan ownership implemented
   locally; preserve the compatibility facade until migration evidence permits removal
8. `R7`: preserve every failed candidate, repair the shared-service capacity
   evidence contract without weakening its thresholds, then requalify a new
   selected commercial-beta candidate only after independent bundle verification

Distributed-truth widening, DSL ergonomics, and broad product expansion remain
behind this sequence unless a separate accepted ADR proves they do not touch a
frozen contract.
